# NEVER RUN SCRIPTS WITHOUT FULLY UNDERSTANDING THEM
3rd Party Scripts of any form, whether via Browser Extensions, Extensions that run scripts or pasting directly in to the console *can* and **will be** ***dangerous***! 

NEVER RUN SCRIPTS WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEY DO!

If you don't understand the code in this script ***do not run it***. Malware can be hidden *easily* when disguised in obscure function calls.

Powerful Script Aimed at Augmenting the Forums

Uses API created by @DatOneLefty
Original Script by @DatOneLefty // "CatsUnited" @Rirurin#5969

# How to Use
This is a self running function, so you can either paste it in to the console on every page you want to use it on, or find some way to run it automagically on page refresh.

# Doesn't this violate *that rule* on the Scratch Discussion Forums
No because it isn't one of those *banned things*, but merely a function. It is unto the user how they want to use and and where.
~~The Scratch Team haven't banned sharing JavaScript Functions I hope~~

# What is next:
@DatOneLefty creating APIv2
Me implementing it (@bybb)
Moar Fun Stuff!!!
